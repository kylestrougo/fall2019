# Grad-Project 4: Contextualizing Data Science

The tools and techniques of Data Science that we have discussed in this class -- from data handling to machine learning -- can be applied broadly across the sciences.  As a final assignment in this class you are to contextualize what we have been discussing and learning about in class into your chosen field of study.

This report should represent a first draft of a talk or paper you would give in your home major about Data Science.  As such, you are expected to professionally typeset this, use proper scientific writing, and cite professional academic sources or reputable online sources.

For your paper please discuss the following:
1. How Data Science has been applied in your major field of study.  Cite between 3-5 academic sources to give credence to these claims.
2. What is a dataset that you might consider using in your academic field of study.  Provide references and discuss the dataset.
3. What techniques would you want to apply to this data set?  What would be important questions to your major field of study that could be answered with this dataset?
 
You can augment the above requirements with anything that you find interesting either from class.  You can research another technique that we did not discuss in class and discuss it as above.

At a minimum this paper must be 2500 words, however I encourage you to take this opportunity to really explore a topic that would be useful for your graduate studies.

## Submission

A PDF of the paper must be submitted through [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/).

## Grading Rubric

* (25 Points). *Professionalism and Creativity:*  Paper is of required length, cites sources correctly, is professionally written.  The paper is interesting and thought has been applied in making the paper applicable and interesting.
* (25 Points).  Discusses Data Science within the major field of study, clearly identifies the field of study and how data can be used in the field.  Cites academic or reputable sources as supporting evidence.
* (25 Points). Dataset discussed is relevant to major course of study -- data is clearly explained and motivated.
* (25 Points).  Example analysis is detailed and relates to the content taught in the course.  Discussion of the hypothesis and/or questions is well reasoned and clear.
