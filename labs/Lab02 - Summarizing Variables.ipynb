    "\n",
    "We can extract the surnames from the names using the [built-in string processing functions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/text.html), all of which are preceded by `.str`. The string processing function that will be most useful to us is `.str.split()`, which allows us to split each string in a `Series` by some sequence of characters.  (In other words, the `split()` function is _broadcast_ over the strings in the `Series`.) Since the surname and other names are separated by `\", \"`, we will split by `\", \"` to obtain two chunks, the first of which is the surname."
