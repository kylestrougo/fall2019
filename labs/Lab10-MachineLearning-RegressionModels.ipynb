    "- a **label** (a.k.a. **response**, **output**, **dependent variable**), such as house price. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can formalize the problem mathematically as follows: let ${\\bf x}$ be the features and $y$ the label; a **predictive model** is a function $f$ that maps ${\\bf x}$ to $y$:\n",

If we wanted to predict the price of a 2700 square foot home using this model, we would simply evaluate $f(2700)$, which comes out to about \\\\$300,000.

There is one catch: `DictVectorizer` expects the data as a list of dictionaries, not as a `DataFrame`. But each row of a `DataFrame` can be represented as a dictionary, where the keys are the column names and the values are the data. `Pandas` provides a convenience function, `.to_dict()`, that converts a `DataFrame` into a list of dictionaries."

When the vectorizer is fit to the training data, it will learn all of the possible categories for each categorical variable so that when `.transform()` is called on different data sets, the same dummy variables will be returned (and in the same order). This is important for us because we need to apply the encoding to two data sets, the training data and the new observation, and we want to be sure that the same dummy variables appear in both."
